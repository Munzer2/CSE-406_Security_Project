ICMP Redirect Attack with ARP Spoofing - Macvlan Implementation
================================================================
This script performs a sophisticated ICMP redirect attack enhanced with ARP spoofing
in a macvlan environment for maximum effectiveness.

Attack Flow:
1. ARP Spoofing: Position attacker as man-in-the-middle between victim and router
2. Traffic Interception: Capture all victim traffic due to MITM position
3. ICMP Redirects: Send forged ICMP redirects to manipulate victim routing
4. Traffic Redirection: Victim routes traffic through attacker

Key Features:
- ARP spoofing for guaranteed traffic interception
- Uses common packet_craft.py library for packet operations
- Real traffic sniffing in macvlan environment  
- Reactive ICMP redirects based on observed traffic
- Proper ICMP redirect packet structure per RFC 792
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Automatic cleanup of ARP spoofing on exit

Network Setup:
- All containers on same macvlan network (10.9.0.0/24)
- Attacker uses ARP spoofing to become man-in-the-middle
- ICMP redirects further manipulate routing tables
